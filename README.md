*Cadence Throw*

Build instructions same as with *Super Derpy* - https://github.com/dos1/SuperDerpy

One major difference: Allegro 5.1 with video addon compiled using FFMPEG backend is needed.

* Crash sample from http://www.freesound.org/people/sandyrb/sounds/95078/
* Videos from My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic - S03E02 and S02E26
* Music:
 - Eduard Khil - I am Glad, ‘cause I’m Finally Returning Back Home
 - William Anderson - song from MLP:FiM season finale credits
